# Grade Java Project

## Project Description
This Java project allows users to input quiz grades, store them in an array, compute the average grade, and determine the corresponding letter grade based on a predefined grading scale. The project specifications include:
1. Printing the project specifications.
2. Inputting quiz grades from the console.
3. Using a loop to continue entering grades until 999 is entered to quit.
4. Populating an array with the quiz grades.
5. Ending the loop after 10 grades are entered or when 999 is entered.
6. Printing all grades in the array.
7. Computing the average quiz grade.
8. Using decision logic to determine the letter grade based on the average.

## How to Use
1. Compile the Java code:
2. Run the compiled Java program:
3. Follow the prompts to enter quiz grades. Enter `999` to quit before entering 10 grades.

## Grading Scale
The letter grade is determined based on the following scale:
- **A**: 90-100
- **B**: 80-89
- **C**: 70-79
- **D**: 60-69
- **F**: 0-59
